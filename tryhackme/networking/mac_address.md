# MAC Address

> **MAC Adress** - An identification sequence of symbols burnt into the **Network Interface chip** of a device.

- Assigned by the factory that made the interface. (Intel, AMD, etc. )

## Example

`a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d`

- 1st three parts of the address represent the vendor who built the interface (Intel, AMD, etc.)
- 2nd three parts are the **unique address** of the network interface

MAC Addresses can be faked by "spoofing".
