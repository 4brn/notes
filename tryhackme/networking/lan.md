# LAN

> **LAN (Local Access Network)** - Network formed by a _cable_ connectivity.

## Topology

A way of connecting devices, forming a pattern

### Star Topology

#### Pros

- common
- reliable
- scalable,
- expensive

#### Cons

- if the central Switch dies, the whole network dies

### Bus Topology

#### Pros

- reliant on the _"backbone"_ cable
- easy to set up
- cost efficient

#### Cons

- bottlenecked because of the _"backbone "_ (main cable) (all data needs to go through it)
- if the "backbone" breaks, the network dies

### Ring Topology (Token)

_Decives connected in a loop_

#### Pros

- Prioritizes sending data first before recieving sent data
- easy to trobuleshoot

#### Cons

- unefficient in data travel.
- prone to bottlenecks.
- if one of the cables is cut, the whole network stops.
