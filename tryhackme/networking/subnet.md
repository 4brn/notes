# Subnetting

> **Subnetting** - Spliting up a Network into smaller networks.

- Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of _hosts_ that can fit within the network, represented by a number called **Subnet Mask**.

### Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways

#### Table Of Subnetting

| Type            | Purpose                                                                                                       | Example       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Network Address | Identifies the start of the actual network                                                                    | 192.168.1.0   |
| Host Address    | Used to identify a device on the subnet                                                                       | 192.169.1.100 |
| Default Gateway | Special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network | 192.168.1.254 |
