## Buffer overflow
- The C programming language is not memory safe. It allows accessing memory outside of the bounds of an array which can result in a segfault. A clever attack can *inject* code that intentionally *overruns the boundary* of an array (also known as a **buffer**) to force a program to act in an unintended way. A piece of software that *exploits* such flaw is known as a **buffer overflow exploit**
## Famous Buffer Overflows
- while modern programs have protection against *overflows*, careless programming still leaves a lot of # opportunities.

#### Notable examples
- The Morris Worm
	- *worm* - harmless intellectual exercise
- AOL Chat Wars 
	- AOL started using a buffer overflow error _in their own client_ to verify that sent messages came from AIM clients. Since Microsoftâ€™s Messenger Service (MMS) clients did not have the same vulnerability, the chat wars ended, with AOL as the victor.
- *reverse engineering* assembly - examining assembly code to reveal knowledge of how it works
## Guess the number
#### Definition
- goal is to win the game (get a return of 0).
- the game is asking for a secret number as well as a secret word.
- the program uses a potential vulnerability - `scanf` 
#### Information Gathering
- set a breakpoint just before the call to `fgets`
- before the call, the arguments are prepared (`%rax` & `%edi`)
	- the strings at the addresses can be examined by `x\s <address>`

- frame pointer `%ebp` is 32 bytes (`sub 0x20, %rsp`, `0x20` is 32 in decimal) away from stack pointer `%esp`
##### IMPORTANT (?)
- `x /48bx $rsp` -> inspect the 48 bytes below register `%rsp`
	- **!** `sub 0x20, %rsp` -> increase stack by 32 bytes
	- 8 bytes for saved `%rbp`
	- 8 bytes for *return address*
	- resulting in total of *48* bytes of stack.

##### IMPORTANT
![[Pasted image 20221120155910.png]]
1. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd00` is `0xf0`
2. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd01` is `0xdd`
3. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd02` is `0xff`
4. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd03` is `0xff`
5. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd04` is `0xff`
6. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd05` is `0x7f`
7. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd06` is `0x00`
8. the **byte** at address `0xf7ffffffdd07` is `0x00`
> the 64-bit VALUE AT ADDRESS 0x7fffffffdd00 is 0x7fffffffddf0
> this is because x86-64 is [little-endian](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/byte_order.html#_integer_byte_order)
- `buf` is located at the TOP of the stack and the first 2 addresses hold the inputted bytes associated with the input `123456789` + `\0` (a null byte)
- `0x00` is the null byte which terminates the string
- *!* `echo $?` prints the return value of the last executed command
#### Exploit 1
- if we run the program with a large string `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123` the program crashes with a segmentation fault with return code `139`
- the input is so large that it *overflows* and *overwrites* the contents of `0xd08` (`x`) and `0xd10` (`saved %rbp`) but also the *return address* (`0xd18`)
	- *!* when the program returns, it tries to *resume execution* at the address *specified by the return address*
	- with input `1234567890`
	 ![[Pasted image 20221120161200.png]]
	- with input `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123`
	![[Pasted image 20221120161222.png]]
		- **smashing the stack** -> the input created a *buffer overrun* and corrupted the stack causing a crash.
#### Exploit 2
- overwrite the stack so the *return address* is replaced with the address of `endGame`.
- to find the address of `endGame` use `disas endGame` (`0x00000000004006da`)
- craft a script which will fill in junk data and then a write the *new* return address.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

char ebuff[]=
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*first 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*next 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*following 10 bytes of junk*/
"\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x30" /*last 10 bytes of junk*/
"\xda\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00" /*address of endGame (little endian)*/
;

int main(void) {
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(ebuff); i++) printf("%c", ebuff[i]);
    return 0;
}
```
- compile the exploit, get the output -> `./secret < exploit.txt`
- `echo $?` returns 1!

## Protection
- *!* Old computer execute bytes from the stack memory. If bytes associated with assembly instructions are placed onto the stack CPU will execute them
- *Stack randomization*
	- randomize the starting position of the stack, multiple machines running the same code will have different stack addresses.
	- bypass -> use a **NOP sled** (i.e., a large number of `nop` instructions) before the actual exploit code.[Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit](http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html). 1996. #look_into 
- *Stack corruption detection* 
	- use a *canary* which is a value stored in nonwriteable section of memory that can be compared to a value put on the stack. If canary "dies" program crashes.
	- bypass -> replace the canary to prevent detection
- *Limiting executable regions*
	- executable code is restricted to particular regions of memory.
	- bypass -> *return-oriented programming (ROP)*, "cherry-pick" instructions and jump from instruction to instruction to build an exploit.
- best line of defense is a good programmer and good code.

|Instead of: |Use:
--- | --- |
|gets(buf)|fgets(buf, 12, stdin)|
|scanf("%s", buf)|scanf("%12s", buf)|
|strcpy(buf2, buf)|strncpy(buf2, buf, 12)|
|strcat(buf2, buf)|strncat(bu2, buf, 12)|
|sprintf(buf, "%d", num)|snprintf(buf, 12, "%d", num)|
- `sprintf` -> store result string in buffer and not `stdout`
