## Terms
- **computer architecture** - design and implementation of the computer processor. 
- **central processing unit** (CPU)
	- executes instructions stored in RAM.
	- a digital processor implements a specific *instruction set architecture* (ISA):
		- set of instructions
		- binary encoding
		- CPU registers
	-  -> SPARC, IA32, MIPS, ARM, ARC, PowerPC, and x86
- **microarchitecture** - defines the circuitry (the components of an electric circuit) of an implementation of a specific ISA. (class which implements an interface).
- Intel and AMD produce different microprocessor implementations of [IA32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IA-32) ISA.
- **reduced instruction set computer** (RISC) - few basic instructions (one clock cycle)
- **complex instruction set computer** (CISC) - more instructions, (multiple clock cycles)
