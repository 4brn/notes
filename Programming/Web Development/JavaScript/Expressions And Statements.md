## Expressions

In programming language terminology, an “expression” is a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value.

`3 + 4` - produces a value (7).
`1999` - produces a value.
`true && false && !false` - produces a value.

***For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not.***

## Statements 

Just a standalone unit of execution and doesn't return anything.

```javascript
if (23 > 10) {
	const str = "23 is bigger"; // statement
}
```
This does *not* produce a value.
Statements (*ends with a ;*).

***For example, 1 has a certain value while go( ) may be executed or not.***
