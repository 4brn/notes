- **LAN (Local Access Network)** - Network formed by a *cable* connectivity.

# Topology

*__Topology__* - a way of connecting devices, forming a pattern

## Star Topology

### Pros:
- common
- reliable
- scalable, 
- expensive

### Cons:
- if the central Switch dies, the whole network dies

## Bus Topology

### Pros:
- reliant on the *"backbone"* cable
- easy to set up
- cost efficient

### Cons:
- bottlenecked because of the *"backbone "* ==cable== (all data needs to go through it)
- if the ==cable== breaks, the network dies

## Ring Topology (Token)

*Decives connected in a loop*

### Pros:

- Prioritizes sending data first before recieving sent data
- easy to trobuleshoot

### Cons:

- unefficient in data travel.
- prone to bottlenecks.
- if one of the cables is cut, the whole network stops.
