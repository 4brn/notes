# Notes:

Once data has been translated or formated from the Presentation (layer 6) layer, the session layer will *create a connection* to the computer that the data is destined for.

When a connection is *established*, a session is 
*created*. 

The session is active, while there is a connection. 

layer 5 ensures that both computers are on the same page before data is sent. 

The data is divided into *smaller* chunks of data (Packets) and begin sending them *one by one*. 

This ensures that if *the connection is lost*, only the *unsent packets* will have to be sent again (not the entire piece).
