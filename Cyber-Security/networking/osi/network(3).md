# Network (3)

It's where **routing** and **re-assembly** takes place.

**routing** - determies the most optimal path for the chunks/packets to be sent.

## Protocols

Protocols used include:

- OSPF(Open Shortest Path First)
- RIP(Routing Information Protocol)

## Factors

Deciding factors for the route are decided by the following:

- What is the shortest path? i.e. least amount of devices that the packets needs to travel accross.

- What path is most reliable? i.e. have packets been lost on that path before?

- What path has faster physical connection? i.e. is one path using **copper** (slower) or **fiber** (faster) connection.

## Devices

Everything is dealt with via IP address.

Devices such as routes, capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as **layer 3** devices.
