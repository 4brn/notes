# Notes:

Layer where *routing* and *re-assembly* takes place.

Routing determies the *most optimal path* for the chunks to be sent.

## Protocols

Protocols used include:
- OSPF(Open Shortest Path First)
- RIP(Routing Information Protocol)

## Factors

Deciding factors for the route are decided by the following:
- What is the shortest path?
	*least amount* of devices that the packets needs to travel accross.

- What path is most reliable?
	i.e. have packets been lost on that path before?

- What path has faster *physical* connection?
	i.e. is one path using *copper* (slower) or *fiber* (faster) connection.

## Devices

Everything is dealt with via IP address. 

Devices such as routes, capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as *layer 3* devices.
